**Convert problematic shell commands into Windows compatible ones.**

Have you ever use deep-agent, or paste AI-generated command, then got errors like "cannot find the path" or "syntax is incorrect"? 

That command made perfect sense — but Windows CMD just wouldn't cooperate.

Then this tool is for you.

## Usage
```python
from win_cmd_fixer import fix_cmd
cmd = fix_cmd('cd D:\my projects')
```

## What it fixes
| Issue                 | Example              | Fixed                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Paths with spaces** | dir C:\Program Files | dir "C:\Program Files" |

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Especially:

- Better heuristics for path detection
- Support for more Windows shell variations (PowerShell, pwsh, Git Bash)
